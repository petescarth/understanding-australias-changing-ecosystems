# Introduction #

Landcover fractions representing the proportions of green, non-green and bare cover retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares unmixing model. Ground cover is defined as the vegetation (living and dead), biological crusts and stones that are in contact with the soil surface (Muir et al, 2011). Ground cover information is important for soil erosion and nutrient flux estimates into the stream network. Ground cover levels may vary due to anthropogenic management of grazing enterprises and agricultural land management practices, or natural changes in seasonal rainfall.


# Details #

The bare soil, green vegetation and non-green vegetation endmenbers are calculated using models linked to an intensive field sampling program whereby more than 1200 sites covering a wide variety of vegetation, soil and climate types were sampled to measure overstorey and ground cover following the procedure outlined in Muir et al (2011). A constrained linear spectral unmixing using the derived endmembers has an overall model Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 11.8%. Values are reported as percentages of cover plus 100. The fractions stored in the 3 result image layers are:  Band1 - bare (bare ground, rock, disturbed), Band2 - green vegetation, Band3 - non green vegetation (litter, dead leaf and branches)
