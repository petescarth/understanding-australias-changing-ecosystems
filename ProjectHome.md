Repository for code and documentation supporting the Google Earth Engine Research Awards Program Project "Understanding Australia's Changing Ecosystems - Linking Long Term Satellite Image and Field Survey Archives" which seeks to answer the question "How can combined satellite image maps and field survey data be used to detect changes in vegetation composition, condition and structure produced by natural and human activities at time scales of month to decades?"


See the [introduction](Introduction.md) and the [project plan](DraftProjectPlan.md) and some [processing examples](http://understanding-ecosystems.appspot.com/).


Currently we're working on extracting the [fractional cover](FractionalCover.md) timeseries data for the [Main Camp Sites](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col11+from+1SBHVmJQkj-Y1Ye9Kyd5omXWm9D3BiTkk2om-8QaF&viz=MAP&h=false&lat=-23.732937975288312&lng=138.48621323923112&t=3&z=12&l=col11&y=2&tmplt=2&hml=KML). The time series plots can be seen on [this](CoverTimeSeries.md) page.
